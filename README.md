# EDEM Climate DAO

This repository includes:
- A sample MRV data upload module.
- A smart contract for Climate DAO governance and MRV report tracking.

## How it works
1. MRV reports are uploaded and stored on IPFS/Filecoin.
2. The DAO smart contract records and verifies reports with CIDs.

This is an MVP demonstration for grant purposes.
