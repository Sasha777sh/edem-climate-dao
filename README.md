Prototype MRV Storage and DAO for EDEM Climate Governance
EDEM Climate DAO

🌍 Decentralized AI platform for Climate MRV and Regenerative Finance (ReFi)
🚀 Project Overview

EDEM Climate DAO is an AI-powered decentralized platform designed to revolutionize climate impact measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), enabling transparent and automated data storage on Filecoin/IPFS and incentivizing climate-positive actions through ReFi (Regenerative Finance) mechanisms.

Our platform empowers climate organizations, communities, and stakeholders to upload verified MRV reports, tokenize carbon credits, and govern climate projects via decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).
🌱 Key Features
	•	AI-Driven MRV: Automated data collection, validation, and verification using advanced AI algorithms.
	•	IPFS/Filecoin Storage: Secure, decentralized storage of MRV data for transparency and accessibility.
	•	DAO Governance: Transparent decision-making and management of climate projects through a decentralized system.
	•	ReFi Tokenization: Creation and management of carbon credits and environmental tokens, incentivizing ecological actions.
 /contracts
    ClimateDAO.sol         // Smart contract for managing MRV reports and DAO votes
/scripts
    mrv_upload.js          // Script to upload MRV data to IPFS/Filecoin
README.md                  // This file
🔗 How It Works
	1.	MRV data is collected and verified by AI agents.
	2.	Reports are uploaded to IPFS/Filecoin for permanent, tamper-proof storage.
	3.	The ClimateDAO smart contract manages reports and enables decentralized governance.
	4.	Verified data can be tokenized into carbon credits for trading or funding ReFi projects.
 💡 Why Filecoin/IPFS?
	•	Transparent and verifiable data storage
	•	Decentralized and censorship-resistant
	•	Scalable solutions for climate data management
 🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Filecoin / IPFS
	•	Solidity Smart Contracts (ClimateDAO.sol)
	•	Node.js (Web3.Storage API)
	•	ReFi / DAO Governance Models
 Phase	Goal	Status
 Roadmap
